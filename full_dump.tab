The nine patients in the control group were undergoing laparoscopic surgery for other gynecological reasons, for a total of 18 patients.

The researchers found no difference when comparing the microbiome composition of control patients to experimental patients. However, when they compared the one (1) stage III endometriosis patient to the rest of the 17 patient cohort, they found 56 OTUs were significantly different, with 22 OTUs only present in the cervix of the stage III patient. 

The results of this signature are therefore not statistically reliable. However, the OTUs present in the stage III endometriosis patients can be used as a reference when looking at other studies who involved stage III endometriosis patients. 

It should also be noted that multiple unidentified species of Barnesiella were reported to be significantly different, but researchers did not specify which species so these were excluded from curation. There were also multiple unidentified species of Ruminococcus and Clostridium.	increased
